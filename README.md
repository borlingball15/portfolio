# **Project Overview**  
Focusing on the theme of **Self as Systems**, my data allows me to understand how much of my time I spend shopping. To visualize how much money I spend and begin to incorporate a healthier relationship with being more grounded and aware, I used the data I collected through Google to recognize patterns and make art.

# **Features**  
Using the senses of the human body, this project categorizes expenditures creatively and acts as a front end to stop impulsive purchases.

# **Technology**  
This project utilizes GitHub, VS Code, YouTube tutorials, and CHATGPT (AI) to clean up the code.
